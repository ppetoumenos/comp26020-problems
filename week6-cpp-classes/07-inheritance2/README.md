The program [inheritance2.cpp](inheritance2.cpp) declares two classes with an
inheritance relationship. It fails to compile due to a coding mistake. Fix the
mistake to have the compiled code produce the following output:
```shell
./inheritance2
derived method called, z: 5. Now calling base_method
base_method called, x: 3, y: 4
```

To check the correctness of your program, use the department VM image with check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `inheritance2.cpp`. In a
terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log ppetoumenos/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week4-c++/07-inheritance2
```

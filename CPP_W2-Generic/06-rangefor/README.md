The program [rangefor.cpp](rangefor.cpp) is the same as the iterators one, but
in this case can your rewrite it to use range-based for loops?

Your code should not:
- Access the vectors using indexes
- Access the vectors using iterators

An example of expected output is:
```shell
./rangefor
16258
```

Check the correctness of your program with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log ppetoumenos/comp26020-problems/main/CPP_W2-Generic/06-rangefor
```

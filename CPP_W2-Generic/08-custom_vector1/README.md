The header [vector.h](vector.h) is a header-only version of the solution from last week's worked example on creating our own integer vector class. This is tailor-made for integers. 

Can you make it generic?

```shell
The size of the vector should be 10 and it's 10

Position 6 had the value 0
Position 6 now has the value 5
The vector should have 11 elements now and it has 11
The vector should have 30011 elements now and it has 30011
Position 6 in v has the value  5
Position 6 in v2 has the value 15

Vector of vectors v3 has 3 subvectors with sizes 1, 5, and 15
```

Check the correctness of your program with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log ppetoumenos/comp26020-problems/main/CPP_W2-Generic/08-custom_vector1
```

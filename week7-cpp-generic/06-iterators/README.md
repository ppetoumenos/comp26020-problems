The program [iterators.cpp](iterators.cpp) copies values from one vector to
another, if the value is odd. The code is using C-like C++. Rewrite the code
copy\_odds() using iterators.

Your code should not:
- Access the vectors using indexes

An example of expected output is:
```shell
./iterators
16258
```

To check the correctness of your program, use the department VM image with check50 installed or alternatively CS50 [sandbox](sandbox.cs50.io)
or [IDE](ide.cs50.io) and write it in a file named `iterators.cpp`. In a
terminal, with that file in the local directory, check with this command:
```shell
check50 -l --ansi-log ppetoumenos/comp26020-problems/2022-2023/week7-cpp-generic/06-iterators
```
